- Insights surface automatically — no manual research required.

## Slide 4 — Why Now
- Explosion in data availability (LinkedIn, patents, media, open datasets).  
- AI models now affordable enough for real-time enrichment.  
- Enterprises demanding faster, leaner CI solutions with self-serve options.

- SAM (Mid-market + SMB CI spend): ~$12B.
